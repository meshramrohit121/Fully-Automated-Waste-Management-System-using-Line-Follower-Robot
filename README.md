# Fully-Automated-Waste-Management-System-using-Line-Follower-Robot

Our project mainly concentrates on offering an easy, reliable solution to the common problem of inefficient garbage disposal
faced in the society, so our system can be used in many places
specially for the Municipal Corporation. For this, we have implement a fully automated, line following garbage bin. In this
system there are two sites. A garbage dumping area. The other
device is the garbage collecting are where the robot will go
and collect the garbage , which starts it’s process after receiving the paramerters about the garbage level from the garbage
collector. Here, the process includes the garbage collector moving through a road visiting each every dustbin, while stopping
to collect garbage if it is allow to do so. This is the main process of the system. The path followed by the garbage collector is
marked in black, in order to pick it up easily by the IR sensors.
When the garbage container becomes full, the container continues straight to its dumpsite. The dumping of garbage is automated as well. When we look at the system design, it is based on
2 parts which are,“the garbage collector” and “the garbage container”. In the implementation of the system, we used “Arduino
IDE” “Thingspeak” to program the microcontrollers and microprocessors. We also used “Thingspeak” “circuito.io” to design
the circuit boards. We used Arduino Yun, motor driver board,
DC geared motors,IR sensors
